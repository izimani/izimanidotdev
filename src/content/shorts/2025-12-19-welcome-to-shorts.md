As mentioned in the post "[Initial commit](/posts/2025-12-19-initial-commit)", I borrowed the idea for the shorts section from [TheSephist](https://thesephist.com) (Linus Lee) and his [stream](https://stream.thesephist.com) format.

Writing high-quality long-form articles takes a lot of time and thinking. In some cases, I don’t want to jump through these hoops. Either because the idea isn’t really worth the effort, or I just want to get it out there immediately.

Having a microblog-like section relieves me of the "proper blog post" shackles, allowing for quick, tweet-like expressions. Like this one: this is the "Hello, World" of shorts.
