While some folks in the software engineering community have relatively strong opinions about their operating systems [("I use Arch, btw")](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/17e3tix/where_did_the_whole_i_use_arch_btw_thing_come_from/), I’ve never really cared. If the OS doesn’t get in my way, and I can do my thing on my computer, I’m just fine.

And believe it or not, even for software development (especially with the introduction of [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)), Windows was just fine! Once I got used to the eye-rolling from fellow devs, I had no issues.

Recently, however, Windows started to get in my way. The bloatware. The AI crap. The telemetry. And consequently, the poor performance and even poorer privacy.

I just want to do my thing on my computer. For that end, I must have an OS installed. But that’s no longer Windows.

Good riddance, Windows! Welcome, [CachyOS](https://cachyos.org/)!
