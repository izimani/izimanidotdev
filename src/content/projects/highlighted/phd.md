There was a truckload of areas within computer science that I found exciting during my uni years. One that really got me hooked, though, was computational models. Like Turing machines, but more esoteric ones.

My advisor, [György Vaszil](https://arato.inf.unideb.hu/vaszil.gyorgy/), showed me a model called reaction systems, which was pretty new at the time (2019-ish). It offered a novel approach to model chemical processes within cells.

We combined this model with another hot area (a common recipe: take two popular things to make a third one), reversible computation, and 💥, 5 years later, I got my PhD.
