Co-founded with [Kristóf Németh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristof-zoltan-nemeth/), Sustainabot is an assistant for green building assessors that makes the certification process less frustrating.

I built the entire application from the ground up, including architectural design, frontend, backend, and infrastructure. Had _tons_ of fun.

The stack includes [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), [fly.io](https://fly.io/), [RunPod](https://www.runpod.io/), and [LangFuse](https://langfuse.com/).
